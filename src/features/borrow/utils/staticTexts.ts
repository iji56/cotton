    { question: 'What if the item doesn’t fit?', answer: 'When ordering an item online there is always a risk. Return within 24 hours of receiving the item for a full refund (less shipping costs) to use as a credit in the app. Items not shipped back within 24 hours will be charged the full rental price. Within 24 hours of receiving the item, please contact rax and the lender that you are sending it back. Items cannot be altered.' },
    { question: 'How do I get the item?', answer: 'If the item is nearby, we suggest meeting up in a safe public area to reduce the need for shipping. If local pick-up is not possible, lenders are responsible for the cost of sending and borrowers are responsible for the cost of returning the item. The shipping labels will be automatically generated by Canada Post in the checkout process in the app.' },
    { question: 'What if I ruin the item?', answer: 'Please treat all items with care — as if you were borrowing from a friend or family member. Opt-in for insurance at the time of borrowing which will cover minor wear and tear to the item. If you do not opt-in for insurance, you are liable for 100% of the full cost of the item.' },
