This Policy describes the information we collect from you via the App and what happens to that information. This Policy applies to all sites under the rax domain or rax brand. If we make any material changes to our privacy practices, we will post a revised Privacy Policy on this page. If you have any questions, please contact us by chatting with rax in the chat function of the app.\n\nIF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY, THEN YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP. IF YOU USE THE APP FOLLOWING A CHANGE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU ARE PROVIDING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRIVACY POLICY AS REVISED. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings ascribed to them in our Terms of Service.\n\n1. Information Collection\nWe may collect information including but not limited to the following about you and your use of our website, app and service (together, our \"app\") in order to create a better, more personalized experience for you or for internal research purposes:\nWe collect your email address, your phone number, your name, username, a password selected by you, your address and postal code, pictures and data that may be selected or entered by you through the app, or retrieved from other 3rd party sites. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.\nWhenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable screens or pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to posting your personal information.\nYou may also (but are not required to) provide information about yourself (such as your location, URL, pictures, height, sizes, gender or a biography). Any additional image or information you provide will be publicly displayed.\nWe automatically track certain information about our members including but not limited to internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, click patterns, etc.), your mobile device's unique ID number, your mobile device's geographic location while the App is actively running, your computer's IP address, technical information about your computer or mobile device (such as type of device, web browser or operating system), your preferences and settings (time zone, language, privacy preferences, product preferences, etc.), the URL of the last web page you visited before coming to one of our sites, the buttons, controls and ads you clicked on (if any), how long you used the app and which services and features you used, the online or offline status of the App.\nPlease be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your profile, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs that you post on the App may reveal these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself, you are explicitly consenting to our processing your information and making this public to other users.\nWe collect information including but not limited to postings you make on the public areas of our website, messages you send to us, and correspondence we receive from other members or third parties about your activities or postings on our website.\nIf you choose to post messages in our chat rooms or other public message areas or leave feedback for other users, please note that such information is available to anyone with Internet access. We may, but are not obligated to, collect the information you post in our chat rooms or other public message areas to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law. PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN DISCLOSING ANY INFORMATION IN CHAT ROOMS, DISCUSSION BOARDS AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION YOU PUBLICLY DISCLOSE.\nUpon your request, we will deactivate your account and remove your personal information from publicly available sections of the App and in accordance with any applicable laws. To make this request, chat with rax in the chat function of the app. Upon our receipt of your request, we will deactivate your account and remove your personal information as soon as reasonably possible from publicly available sections of the App. Nonetheless, we will retain in our files information you may have requested us to remove if, in our sole discretion, retention of the information is necessary to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems or to enforce the Terms of Service Agreement. Furthermore, your information may never be completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints (for example, we may not remove your information from our back up storage).\n\n2. Use of Information\nWe have established procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. However, the internet is an open system, and we can make no guarantees as to the security or privacy of your information submitted to the app. For this reason, we recommend that you use anti-virus software, routine credit checks, firewalls and other precautions to protect yourself from security and privacy threats.\nYour information will be shared with other users when you and such other users agree to share, borrow, rent or obtain goods through the App for such purposes. We will use your information to complete transactions requested by you.\nWe use the information we collect about you to create a better, more personalized experience for you based on your individual usage habits, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze site usage and disclose aggregated statistics, improve our content and product offerings, aid in our monetization efforts, and customize our app's content, layout and services. We also use the information we collect about you to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our Terms of Service Agreement. We may use your correspondence with us, information posted by you or photographs submitted for publication on the App for promotional, sales or any use that we consider appropriate, whether submitted via email, postings on the App or feedback via the member polls.\nWe may share your information with third party partners or third parties hired by us to perform functions and provide services to us subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and on the condition that the third parties use your information only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We may keep track of your device’s geographic location so that we can connect you to other users, items or services, based on your particular geographic location.\nWe may disclose any information in response to a legal request such as a subpoena, court order, or government demand, to investigate or report illegal activity, or to enforce our rights or defend claims. We may also transfer your information to another company in connection with a partnership or a corporate restructuring, such as a sale or merger.\nMessages about the Service and Your Account We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our Services are temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.\nBased upon the Personal Information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, to manage your account, and to provide the best customer service possible.\n\nApp and Email Notifications\nIf you download and use the App, and have enabled push notifications on your mobile device, we may send you alerts and notifications through push notifications, for example, to communicate shipping status for goods you rent. You can opt out of these transactional messages by changing the settings on your mobile device or unsubscribing on email.\n\n3. Children's privacy\nrax does not allow persons under 18 to register for any service, and we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from persons under the age of 18.\n\n4. Information from users outside Canada\nIf you’re outside Canada your information will be sent to and stored in Canada, where our servers are located. By using the app, you agree to the information collection, use, and sharing practices described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n5. Third Party Websites\nThe App may contain links to other websites. Please note that our Privacy Policy and information collection, use and sharing procedures do not apply to other websites. We take no responsibility for and incur no liability for other websites’ collection, use or sharing of information. Please review the privacy policies provided by each website linked to the app to familiarize yourself with the procedures of such websites.\n\n6.

// rax charges the Lender or Seller a 20% Service Fee. The amount of the fee is calculated from the price the Lender sets for each item listed for rent. You will see the Service Fee when you set your price before submitting an item for rent. The Service Fee is automatically deducted from the payout.
// Upon your order (request) through the App, you hereby authorize us to charge your payment method for the applicable fees. In addition, at the time of your order, you hereby agree to pay and authorize us to charge your payment method on file an additional amount up to 200% of the retail price of the rented goods set forth on the App in case of a dispute, at our sole discretion. We will generally charge you a fee when the App has facilitated the process of borrowing and lending via the exchange of information, potentially including contact information, and credits. We may, in our sole discretion, and by notifying you via email, change this policy and begin charging for access to our App and other features and services, and we may, in our sole discretion, add, remove or change the features and services we offer or the fees (including the amount or the type of fees) we charge at any time.

// PAYMENTS & REFUNDS. Payout requests are to be made from within the rax App and will be processed in 3-5 business days, depending on Stripe. Credits received from rax from promotions or otherwise, are not redeemable for cash; they are strictly for use on the rax App and may expire. Payments will be made via direct deposit. The timing of processing and delivering payments will typically take at least three to five business days, sometimes more.
// COLLECTIONS. If you do not pay the amounts you owe to rax when due, rax will need to institute collection procedures. You agree to pay rax’s costs of collection, including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees.
// CANCELLATION POLICY.
// For the Borrower: You may cancel your rental order subject to the following cancellation fees and policies:
// If you cancel fourteen (14) or more days in advance of the borrow date, there is no cancellation fee and you will receive a 100% refund of the Rental Fee issued to the payment method you used for the order.
// If you cancel less than fourteen (14) days but more than seven (7) days in advance of the borrow date, you will receive a refund of 50% of the Rental Fee.
// If you cancel seven (7) or fewer days in advance of the borrow date, you will forfeit 100% of the Rental Fee.

// For the Lender: You may cancel an approved rental order subject to the following cancellation fees and policies:
// You may cancel a rental more than seven (7) days before the rental begins with no penalty.
// If you cancel within seven (7) days or less of the rental state date, you will be charged a $25 cancellation fee.
// If you fail to ship a borrowed item you will be charged a $50 fee and may be banned from using rax.
// LATE FEES.
// For the Borrower: If you return the Products late or not at all, a late fee of ten dollars ($10.00) a day will be charged to the payment method you used to pay the Rental Fee or to any other payment method included in your account information that you have provided to rax for each day that you are late returning the Products, and you agree to pay such late fees, up to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Retail Value plus applicable sales tax (plus the Rental Fee). If you have not returned a Product within seven (7) days after the return date for the Product, your late return will be considered a non-return and rax will charge your payment method up to 100% of the purchase price of the item plus the maximum late fee set forth in this Section, less any late fees that you have already paid, plus applicable sales tax.
// For the Lender: If, as Lender, you ship a Product late, as deemed by rax, the Borrower has the right to cancel the Rental and receive a full refund, in which case the Lender will be charged the late shipping fee as described herein, plus the full commission owed to rax for that Rental and the shipping charge. If the Borrower chooses to proceed with the Rental, they have the option of returning it on the original return date, and receive a credit for the average daily rental rate that the Product was late. Alternatively, if the Borrower would like to extend the Rental by the number of days the Product was delivered late, they will have the option to do so, at no additional charge, with the approval of the Lender. In all cases, the Lender will be responsible for the full commission owed to rax, giving rax the right to charge the Lender’s account for any difference that is over the Lender’s earned income.
// When in question, rax will use tracking information provided by the shipping carriers to determine the date an item was shipped, whether from the Lender or the Borrower.
// Shipping, Receipt & Return of Products
// SHIPPING. When shipping an item to a Borrower, it must be put in the mail on day 1 of the rental period. It is the responsibility of the Lender to ensure the item is shipped on the first day of the Rental. If an item arrives late to the Borrower, whether due to late shipment or shipping carrier delays, the Borrower will have the opportunity to return the item the next day for a full refund. It will be at rax’s sole discretion to decide if the late arrival was the fault of the Lender or the shipping carrier. In cases where rax determines it was the fault of the Lender, and the Borrower decides to return the item for a refund, the Lender will be charged in accordance with the Late Fee as described above and will not receive payment for the transaction. In cases where it was the fault of the shipping carrier, the Borrower may still return the product and receive a full refund, and the Lender will not receive payment. Regardless of when the item is received, it must be returned by the original return date, unless otherwise agreed upon between the Lender and the Borrower via in-App Messenger and rax is notified.

// RECEIPT OF THE PRODUCTS. you agree to bear responsibility for receipt of Products shipped to the location specified at time of check out. You acknowledge that in all cases, a Secure Shipping Address is highly recommended. A Secured Shipping Address means a location where an individual can physically receive Product(s). In no event does rax bear responsible for lost packages, whether with the shipping carrier or once delivered. Once delivered, the package and its contents are the responsibility of the person delivered to, whether that be the Borrower or the Lender. Furthermore, you acknowledge that providing anything other than a Secure Shipping Address may result in delivery delays and additional delivery fees for which rax will not be liable. You will be liable for all such delays and additional delivery fees.
// USE OF THE PRODUCTS. You, the Borrower, agree to treat the Products with great care, as if it was owned by you. You are responsible for loss, destruction or damage to the Products due to theft, mysterious disappearance, fire, major stains or any other cause, other than normal wear and tear.
// Normal wear and tear may occur and is not covered by the Borrower. We consider normal wear and tear to include stains which can be removed by proper cleaning, minor snags, missing beads, stuck zippers or other minor damage. If you return a Product that is damaged beyond normal wear and tear, then you agree that we shall charge you, and you shall pay, for the price for repairing or replacing the Product, as determined in our discretion. If the Product cannot be repaired or replaced, as determined in our discretion, you will be charged up to 100% of the Retail Value plus applicable sales tax (plus the Rental Fee) using the payment method you used to pay the Rental Fee or any other payment method included in your account information that you have provided to us.
// As a Lender you acknowledge that normal wear and tear may occur. Normal wear and tear may occur and is not covered by the Borrower or rax. We consider normal wear and tear to include stains which can be removed by proper cleaning, minor snags, missing beads, stuck zippers or other minor damage. If you receive a returned Product that is damaged beyond normal wear and tear, rax will first attempt to have the product repaired at the Borrower’s expense. Should the item not be repairable or not returned, rax will do their best to mediate between the Lender and Borrower to replace the product OR reimburse the Lender the current resale value of the item, based on it’s last known condition at the Borrower’s expense. The value of such replacement will be determined solely by rax.
// In all cases of damage, or items not meeting the description as listed for the Product, the Lender or Borrower must notify rax within 24 hours of the receipt of the Product.  After this time period, rax is under no obligation to mediate any discrepancies between the Lender and the Borrower.
// RETURN OF THE PRODUCTS; EXTENSIONS. You agree to return the Products to the Lender in the same packaging you received the Products in (including any garment/dust bags or boxes) on or before the return date for the Products that are identified in the online invoice for your order. If you lose the Return Packaging, you will be responsible for safe return of the item at your own expense by the expected return date, and providing rax with a tracking number. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations of this clause shall not apply to the Rental Fee, which is charged separately from, and in addition to, any other charges payable by you pursuant to this Section. If the Return Packaging is lost or not in adequate condition, the Borrower is responsible for finding adequate substitute packaging. rax is not responsible for any personal or other items left in the Products or which are returned to the Lender. If you believe you have accidentally or otherwise sent any such items, please contact rax as soon as possible by chatting with rax in the chat function of the app. Our staff may assist in attempting to locate such items at a customer’s request, but are not obligated to and assume no liability for doing so.
// RETURNS As a Borrower, if you borrow a Product and it does not fit you or is not as described you may received a refund in the form of a rax credit if you (1) notify the Lender of the return via in App Messenger within 24 hours of receiving the Product (2) notify rax in the messaging section of the app and (3) return the Product to the Lender within 24 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) of the date you received the Product in conformance with the return procedure as defined herein. Once Lender confirms receipt of Product, rax will then issue a refund in the form of a rax credit (see Fees & Payments section) for the full Rental Fee less shipping fee, so long as the Product, in the Lender’s discretion, has not been worn. rax credits received from fit issues do not expire and cannot be redeemed for cash.
// As a Lender, you will be notified of a fit or quality return via email from rax and agree to accept the return of the rental. You agree to not earn payment for an item which was returned for a fit issue or for the condition of a Product not being in proper condition.
// Reporting Misconduct
// If you participate in a conversation via in App Messenger with a user who has acted inappropriately including without limitation a user who (a) engages in offensive, violent or sexually inappropriate behavior, (b) you suspect of stealing from you or (c) engages in other disturbing conduct, you should immediately report such person to the appropriate authorities and then to rax by providing us with your police report number; provided, however, that your report will not obligate us to take any action beyond that required by law (if any) or cause us to incur any liability to you or any other person.
// Third Party Services
// The App may contain links to third party websites or content from third party websites that are not controlled under these Terms of Service. You acknowledge that rax is not liable or responsible for any third party websites or any third party content, information or products made available at third party websites. You acknowledge sole responsibility and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources. You are responsible for reading the terms and conditions and privacy policies of third party websites that you visit and for complying with those terms and conditions and policies. The parties hereto that any third party suppliers of rax or the third party websites referenced above in this paragraph (collectively, the “Third Party Beneficiaries”) are intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement. The parties agree that, except with respect to the Third Party Beneficiaries, this Agreement is for the benefit of the Parties hereto and is not intended to confer any rights or benefits on any third party, and that there are no other third party beneficiaries of this Agreement or any part or specific provision of this Agreement. To the extent you access the App through a mobile or wireless device, your carrier’s standard charges, data rates and other fees may apply.
// General Provisions
// rax reserves the right to modify, amend or change the Terms of Service at any time (a “Change”). In certain circumstances, we may send an email to you notifying you of any Change. You should regularly check this page to take notice of any Changes. If you do not accept any Change to the Terms of Service, you should stop using rax immediately. Your continued use of the App, following any Change constitutes your acceptance of the Change and you will be legally bound by the new updated Terms of Service.
// If, for any reason, any of the Terms of Service are declared to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court of a competent jurisdiction, then to the extent that term is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, it shall be severed and deleted from the Terms of Service and the remainder of the Terms of Service shall survive, remain in full force and effect and continue to be binding and enforceable.
// No failure or delay by us in exercising any right, power or privilege under the Terms of Service shall operate as a waiver of such right or acceptance of any variation of the Terms of Service and nor shall any single or partial exercise by either party of any right, power or privilege preclude any further exercise of that right or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Nothing in the Terms of Service shall confer or purport to confer on any other third party any benefit or the right to enforce any term of the Terms of Service, unless otherwise expressly set forth herein. All parties to this Agreement hereby waive their right to a trial by jury, in the event there is any dispute arising out of or relating to the agreement or the transaction.
// This Agreement is binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of both parties and their respective successors, heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, and permitted assigns. You may not assign this Agreement without rax’s prior written consent. rax may transfer or assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time, without your consent.
// This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Canada, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. The Uniform Commercial Code, the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act, and the United Nations Convention of Controls for International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement or the App .
// Dispute Resolution
// You and rax agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the App (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and rax are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and rax otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.
// The arbitration will be administered by the Arbitration Act. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and rax submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Act. Subject to the Arbitration Act, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
// The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the Arbitration Act. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.
// Your responsibility to pay any filing, administrative, legal and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the Arbitration Act.
